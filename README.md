alg-top-notes
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silky/alg-top-notes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silky/alg-top-notes)

These notes are viewable online at
[Authorea](https://authorea.com/users/7271).

You can build this locally with

    ./build_mainfile.py && latexmk -pvc -pdf alg-top-notes.tex

(This regenerates the main TeX file and asks latexmk to watch for any changes
 you make locally, and asks latexmk to preview the resulting pdf.)
