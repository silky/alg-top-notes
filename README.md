**Note**: These notes are out of date at the moment pending the resolution of
some issues; more information can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenScienceWorkshops/OpenScienceWorkshops.github.io/issues/50).

You can build this locally with

    ./build_mainfile.py && latexmk -pvc -pdf alg-top-notes.tex

(This regenerates the main TeX file and asks latexmk to watch for any changes
 you make locally, and asks latexmk to preview the resulting pdf.)
